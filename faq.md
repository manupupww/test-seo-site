      <h2 itemprop="name">1. How much does junk removal cost in Vilnius? What factors influence the price?</h2>
      <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <p itemprop="text">The cost of junk removal in Vilnius varies depending on several factors. At Valymo Meistrai, we consider the volume of junk (measured in cubic meters), the type of junk (construction debris, appliances, furniture, etc.), the location (difficult access may incur extra costs), and any required disassembly or special handling.  Generally, our prices start from around €50 for small loads (e.g., a few bags of unwanted items). For larger loads, full house cleanouts, or construction debris removal, the price will be higher. To get an accurate estimate, we highly recommend contacting us for a free, no-obligation quote. You can call us at +370 5 214 0310 or use our online form to describe your needs. We offer transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Keep in mind that illegal dumping is a serious issue in Vilnius and we always dispose of waste responsibly.</p>
