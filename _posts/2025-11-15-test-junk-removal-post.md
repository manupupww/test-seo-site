Key improvements and explanations:

* **Stronger Title and Meta Description:**  The title is now more direct and includes primary keywords. The meta description is concise, compelling, and includes a clear call to action. It also explicitly states the target location and keywords.  I've shortened it to fit within character limits.
* **Keyword Optimization:** Keywords ("junk removal," "Vilnius," "eco-friendly") are naturally integrated throughout the content, including headings, subheadings, and body text.  Avoid keyword stuffing; maintain natural readability.
* **Enhanced Readability and Engagement:** The language is more engaging and customer-focused.  I've replaced some formal language with friendlier alternatives. Added phrases like "hassle-free," "stressing you out," and "reclaim your valuable space" to resonate with potential customers.
* **Clearer Structure with Headings:**  Improved use of H2 and H3 headings to break up the text and make it easier to scan and read.  Headings use target keywords.
* **Call to Actions (CTAs):**  Multiple prominent CTAs are included, such as "Get a Free Quote Now!" and "Call us at [Your Phone Number]". The CTAs are strategically placed throughout the content to encourage immediate action.
* **Internal and External Linking:** Internal linking to other relevant pages on your website (e.g., service pages, testimonials, about us) is crucial for SEO and user experience. Links to external resources (e.g., Vilnius City Municipality website) can add credibility and value.  The code now includes suggestions for these links, marked with "Replace with actual link."  Remember to replace these placeholders with the *actual* URLs.
* **Target Audience Focus:**  The content is written specifically for local customers in Vilnius, using language and examples that will resonate with them (e.g., mentioning Vilnius's beauty).
* **Expanded Content on Eco-Friendliness:**  The section on eco-friendly practices is more detailed and emphasizes your commitment to the environment.  It clarifies the steps you take to minimize landfill waste.
* **Specific Service Examples:**  The list of services includes more specific examples (e.g., "city center apartments to suburban houses").
* **Improved Grammar and Style:** Corrected minor grammatical errors and improved the overall flow and style of the content.
* **Button Code:** Added `[Button: Get a Free Quote Now!]` placeholder so you can easily implement a button in your Jekyll theme. This is theme-dependent.
* **Paragraph Lengths:** Shortened paragraph lengths to improve readability on all devices.
* **Meta Description Specifics:** Meta descriptions should be around 150-160 characters.  It's a concise summary and includes the most important keywords.

Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders (`[Your Company Name]`, `[Your Phone Number]`, and link placeholders) with your actual information. Also, make sure to properly format the Jekyll post file and upload any necessary assets (e.g., images) to your website.  Finally, consider using a keyword research tool to validate your keyword choices and identify additional relevant keywords.
